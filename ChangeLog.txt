LavidaCraft 1.14 {

Java and Bedrock Features:
New Features:
 - Added Nether Quartz texture
 - Added Copper Nugget texture
 - Added Blaze texture. Only a minor adjustment to the eyes. Why did they look human in Vanilla?
 - Added Water Bucket texture where the water is dripping slightly. (Like Minecraft's old texture)
Updates:
 - Created a new format for ChangeLogs for better readability
 - Improved most Heart, Hunger, and Armour HUD textures slightly
 - Improved Nether Wart texture slightly
 - Updated ReadMe
 - Updated Gold and Iron Nugget textures
 - Updated Creeper texture. Now easier on the eyes and removed most of the vines from it
 - Redstone Torches are no longer animated. I wasn't fond of that look anymore
 - Updated Slot texture colors. They now match the Vanilla colors
 - Fishing Rod texture's string now matches the color of Bow texture's string
 - Slight change to the Netherite Pickaxe texture.

Java Exclusive Features:
New Features:
 - Added a Respackopts option to have nuggets only looks like coins when named Iron or Gold Coin
 - Added a Gold Nugget texture for the named option for nuggets. It has a slightly better outline than the Vanilla texture
 - Added Villager Experience Bar textures. This wasn't an issue that needed to be resolved for Bedrock
 - Added an option with Respackopts to enable an alternative look for Splash Potions
 - Added Farmland Side texture
 - Added Copper Torch texture
 - Added Mcmeta file to blur the End Flashes
Updates:
 - Updated Torch models. They should now look better especially when placed on walls
 - Redstone Torches are now toggled by the "Torches" toggle rather than "Redstone"
 - Updated pack.mcmeta to the new format
Fixes:
 - Fixed the shading on the edges of the XP and Jump Bars
 - Fixed credits in block and item models
Technical Changes:
 - Moved all custom textures unique to LavidaCraft from their own namespace to subfolders. This just makes editing easier for me

Bedrock Exclusive Features:
Updated:
 - Added full support for the XP bar. Finally found a way to do it
