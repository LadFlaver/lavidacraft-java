LavidaCraft 1.13
Added:
 - Mers textures for Vibrant Visuals support. (Bedrock)
 - Toggle for custom loading screen. (Java)
Updated:
 - Brewing Stand texture.
 - Experience and Jump bars. The way Bedrock handles these is really stupid and makes it so I can't really port these changes. (Java)
Removed:
 - Unused Jump Bar Cooldown texture (Java)

LavidaCraft 1.12
Added:
 - Creeper texture. This is heavily inspired by the Lush Creepers resource pack. Check it out.
 - Fletching Table texture. Now matches the bowstring color of bows.
 - Nether Wart texture for items. Inspired by Theredheadedkid2.
 - Barrel textures. The lid is now squared. Why was it a circle in Vanilla?
Updated:
 - Potted Cactus textures. (Java)
 - Enderman texture.
 - Shield slot texture.
 - Magma Block texture.
 - Chiseled Stone Bricks texture. Slight shading adjustments.
 - Bedrock texture. Based off of gabbro rock.
 - End Crystal texture. Matches the new bedrock.
Fixed:
 - Rail Corner texture.
Removed:
 - Textures for Coal, Copper, Diamond, Gold, Iron, and Lapis Ore.
 - Built in Rail Fix and Glowing Blocks Fix. These will remain available on my Modrinth profile. Including them in this pack feels redundant to me. (Java)
