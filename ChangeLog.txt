LavidaCraft 1.11
Added:
 - Textures for Chicken variants.
Updated:
 - Honey Bottle texture to be more distinct from potions, and more in-line with Vanilla's style.
Technical:
 - Removed interpolation from torch and soul torch animations as it caused strange artifacts in the UI. This should not greatly effect the appearance of these items. (Java)
 - Removed unnecessary frame order from redstone ore animations. (Bedrock)
Fixed:
 - Glowstone is now actually updated. I'm not sure why it didn't work last update.

 - Pack format to 1.21.5.

Technical:
 - Gave Rail Fix textures their own namespace. (Java)
