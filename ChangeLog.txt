LavidaCraft 1.12
Added:
 - Creeper texture. This is heavily inspired by the Lush Creepers resource pack. Check it out.
 - Fletching Table texture. Now matches the bowstring color of bows.
 - Nether Wart texture for items. Inspired by Theredheadedkid2.
Updated:
 - Potted Cactus textures. (Java)
 - Enderman texture.
 - Shield slot texture.
 - Magma Block texture.
Fixed:
 - Rail Corner texture.
Removed:
 - Textures for Coal, Copper, Diamond, Gold, Iron, and Lapis Ore.
 - Built in Rail Fix and Glowing Blocks Fix. These will remain available on my Modrinth profile. Including them in this pack feels redundant. (Java)

LavidaCraft 1.11
Added:
 - Added support for the Respackopts mod. (Java)
 - Dragon Egg textures and custom model. Only partial support exists for the new textures in the Bedrock version.
 - Dragon Egg emissive texture. (Java)
 - Custom models for light emitting blocks that make them appear more glowy in the inventory similar to how they appear in Bedrock. (Java)
Updated:
 - Honey Bottle texture to be more distinct from potions, and more in-line with Vanilla's style.
 - Dragon Breath. No longer has transparency and has been improved slightly.
 - Experience Bottle. Now matches Vanilla style better.
 - Enderman texture. Overhauled appearance.
 - Bottle texture. Improved appearance.
 - Potion, lingering potion, and splash potion textures.
 - Hotbar textures.
Technical:
 - Removed interpolation from torch and soul torch animations as it caused strange artifacts in the UI. This should not greatly effect the appearance of these items. (Java)
 - Removed unnecessary frame order from redstone ore animations. (Bedrock)
 - Added face culling to the bottom of torches. (Java)
 - Added face culling to the top of potted cacti. (Java)
Fixed:
 - Glowstone is now actually updated. I'm not sure why it didn't work last update.
 - Fixed a clipping issue on potions. (Java)
Removed:
 - Chicken textures. They will be available as a minipack on my Modrinth page.
 - Cracked highlighted buttons. (Java)
