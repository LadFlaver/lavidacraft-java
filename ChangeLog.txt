LavidaCraft 1.14
Added:
 - Respackopts option to have nuggets only looks like coins when named Iron or Gold Coin. (Java)
 - Gold nugget texture for the named option for nuggets. It has slightly better outlines than the Vanilla texture. (Java)
 - Villager Experience bar textures. This wasn't an issue that needed to be resolved for Bedrock. (Java)
 - Option with Respackopts to enable an alternative look for Splash Potions. (Java)
 - Nether Quartz texture.
 - Farmland Side texture. (Java)
 - Copper Nugget texture.
 - Copper Torch texture. (Java)
Updated:
 - Improved most Heart textures slightly.
 - Improved Nether Wart texture slightly.
 - Added full support for the XP bar. Finally found a way to do it. (Bedrock)
 - Updated ReadMe.
 - Torch models. They should now look better especially when placed on walls. (Java)
 - Gold and Iron nugget textures.
Fixed:
 - Shading on the edges of the XP and Jump Bars. (Java)
 - Credits in models. (Java)
Technical:
 - Moved all custom textures unique to LavidaCraft from their own namespace to subfolders. This just makes editing easier for me. (Java)

LavidaCraft 1.13
Added:
 - Mers textures for entities and block for Vibrant Visuals support. Mers textures for items will be added at a later time. (Bedrock)
 - Square Moon texture that can be enabled through Respackopts. (Java)
 - Toggle for custom loading screen. (Java)
Updated:
 - Brewing Stand texture.
 - Experience and Jump bars. The way Bedrock handles these is really stupid and makes it so I can't really port these changes. (Java)
 - Method for preventing Seagrass clipping. Formerly used textures, now uses block models to appear the same as Vanilla Bedrock. (Java)
 - Pack format for newer Minecraft versions. (Java)
Removed:
 - Unused Jump Bar Cooldown texture. (Java)
 - Unused textures for Dried Kelp. (Bedrock)
 - Removed Tall Seagrass textures as Bedrock doesn't have any clipping issues with it. (Bedrock)
