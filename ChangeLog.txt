LavidaCraft 1.13
Added:

 - Square Moon texture that can be enabled through Respackopts. (Java)
 - Toggle for custom loading screen. (Java)
Updated:
 - Brewing Stand texture.
 - Experience and Jump bars. The way Bedrock handles these is really stupid and makes it so I can't really port these changes. (Java)

 - Pack format for newer Minecraft versions. (Java)
Removed:
